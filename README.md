Project and Inventory Tracker

This is where the project description will go once we figure out what we even want to build.

The front end of the project will be built in both Angular and Razor Pages maintaining similar functionality in both apps.

The back end is an ASP .NET Core Web API with a SQL Server datastore.  Core contains the domain model and main interfaces.  Infrastructure contains service implementation. Sql contains SQL Server repo, command, and query implementation.
